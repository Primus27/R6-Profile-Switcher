# FAQ

### Question 1
**Question:** Does this swap your skins by swapping out your save file? Because that's technically bannable isn't it? Or only if its for skins you don't have?

**Answer:** This program is not a cheat program and does not hook into the game. It swaps the save file (1.save) with one that belongs to you (and only you). <ins>This way it doesn't swap skins with anything you don't have</ins>. Bear in mind, "1.save" only handles skins and attachments and considering that this script uses "copies" of your profiles, it will never equip something that you have never equipped yourself.

# Troubleshooting

### Issue 1
**Issue:** Double clicking on the program opens a text editor or other program.

**Solution:** File associations are set up wrong. Right click on the python file and select `open with`. Choose `python` from the list or click `more apps ðŸ «` and select `python`.

&nbsp;

### Issue 2
**Issue:** Program does not launch / immediately crashes.

**Solution:** This happens because Python was not added to your (environment variables) PATH (See installation). You can verify this by opening command prompt where the program is located and typing `python switch_v3.py`. Receiving an error such as `this system cannot run the specified program` or `'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command` means that you need to add python to your PATH. [This video shows you how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2q_b4ugPWk)

&nbsp;

### Issue 3
**Issue:** Program launches and displays title (program name and developer...) but does not load menu options immediately.

**Solution:** This happens because an API call is made to R6tabs to check what accounts are on your system. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do here as it typically takes 1-2 seconds to receive a response.

&nbsp;

### Issue 4
**Issue:** Program is not recognising my accounts.

**Solution:** The program was set up in a way that users don't have to enter any information, including drive paths. 
Whilst recent program versions check every drive for your accounts, it is still expected that they follow the format: `{drive}://Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/savegames`

### Multiple Siege Accounts

#### Method 1
If you have multiple accounts and aren't sure about which account is the right one, open up: **"C:\Users\\{name}\Documents\My Games\Rainbow Six - Siege\\{any profile}\GameSettings.ini"** and change **AimDownSightsMouse** ~line 109 to any number. Load up the game and see whether that account's ADS was affected. Keep trying until you find the right account.

#### Method 2
Visit [R6Tab](https://tabstats.com/siege) and enter your playername.
Afterwards, check the URL and your account ID will be seen at this part of the URL:
https://tabstats.com/siege/player/{name}/{**account_ID**}
